## Problem 1

This problem utilizes data on childrenâ€™s birthweight and variables that
may be related to this variable.

This code chunk loads and tidies the data.

``` r
birthweight = 
  read_csv("./data/birthweight.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    babysex = as.factor(babysex),
    frace = as.factor(frace),
    mrace = as.factor(mrace),
    babysex = recode(babysex, `1` = "male", `2` = "female"),
    frace = recode(frace, `1` = "white", `2` = "black", `3` = "asian", `4` = "puerto rican", `8` = "other", `9` = "unknown"),
    mrace = recode(mrace, `1` = "white", `2` = "black", `3` = "asian", `4` = "puerto rican", `8` = "other"),
    malform = recode(malform, `0` = "absent", `1` = "present")) %>%
  view()
```
