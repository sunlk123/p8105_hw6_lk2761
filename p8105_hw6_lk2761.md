## Problem 1

This problem utilizes data on childrenâ€™s birthweight and variables that
may be related to this variable.

This code chunk loads and tidies the data.

``` r
birthweight = 
  read_csv("./data/birthweight.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    babysex = as.factor(babysex),
    frace = as.factor(frace),
    mrace = as.factor(mrace),
    malform = as.factor(malform),
    babysex = recode(babysex, `1` = "male", `2` = "female"),
    frace = recode(frace, `1` = "white", `2` = "black", `3` = "asian", `4` = "puerto rican", `8` = "other", `9` = "unknown"),
    mrace = recode(mrace, `1` = "white", `2` = "black", `3` = "asian", `4` = "puerto rican", `8` = "other"),
    malform = recode(malform, `0` = "absent", `1` = "present")) %>%
  view()
```

This code chunk fits a regression model. The predictors included are
`momage`, `smoken`, `ppbmi`, `ppwt` and
`delwt`.

``` r
fit = lm(bwt ~ momage + smoken + ppbmi + ppwt + delwt, data = birthweight)
```

This code creates a scatterplot comparing the residuals against the
fitted values.

``` r
birthweight %>%
  modelr::add_residuals(fit) %>%
  modelr::add_predictions(fit) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid)) + 
  geom_point()
```
